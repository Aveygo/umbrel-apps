version: "1.924"
tagline: The YaCy Peer-to-Peer Search Engine Software
description: >-
  The YaCy search engine software provides results from a network of independent peers, instead of a central server. 
  It is a distributed network where no single entity decides what to list or order it appears in.
  User privacy is central to YaCy, and it runs on each user's computer, where search terms are hashed before they being sent to the network. 
  Everyone can create their individual search indexes and rankings, and a truly customized search portal.

  Not an *official* release - Created by @Aveygo, hope it suits your needs.
